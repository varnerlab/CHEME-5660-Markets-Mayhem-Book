# Fixed Income Securities

## Introduction
Fixed-income securities are financial instruments with predefined cashflows of a specified fixed amount paid at selected dates over the lifetime of the instrument. While there are several types of fixed-income securities, in this lecture, we focus on a single archetypal category: [United States Treasury Securities](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/treasury-securities). 

Treasury securities, e.g., [Treasury bills, notes, and bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tbonds_glance.htm), are debt obligations issued by the United States Department of the Treasury. Treasury securities are one of the safest investments, e.g., defacto risk-free, because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Thus, treasury securities are a mechanism used by the United States government to borrow money, from bond holders, with a fixed set of repayment terms. 

In this lecture, we will introduce three types of treasury securities:

## Treasury Bonds
Treasury bonds pay a fixed rate of interest every six months until matururation. Bonds are issued in a term of 20 years or 30 years. When a bond matures, the owner is paid the face value of the bond.
Bonds can be held until maturity or sold before maturity. Interest income from Treasury bonds is exempt from state and local income taxes, but subject to federal income taxes.

You can buy Treasury bonds directly from the [United States Treasury via TreasuryDirect](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tbonds_glance.htm), or through a bank or broker.

## Treasury Bills
Treasury bills (also called T-bills) are sold in terms ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. Bills are typically sold at a discount from the par amount (par amount is also called face value); rarely they have sold at a price equal to the par amount. When a bill matures, you are paid its par amount. 

Treasury bills are issued for terms of 4, 8, 13, 26, and 52 weeks; 4-week, 8-week, 13-week, 26-week, and 52-week bills are auctioned on a regular schedule.  Interest income from T-bills is exempt from state and local income taxes but subject to federal income taxes.

Like bonds, you can buy T-bills directly from the [United States Treasury via TreasuryDirect](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tbonds_glance.htm) or through a bank or broker.
