# Fixed Income Securities

## Introduction
Fixed-income securities are financial instruments with predefined cashflows of a specified fixed amount paid at selected dates over the lifetime of the instrument. While there are several types of fixed-income securities, in this lecture, we focus on a single archetypal category: [United States Treasury Securities](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/treasury-securities). 

Treasury securities, e.g., [Treasury bills, notes, and bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tbonds_glance.htm), are debt obligations issued by the United States Department of the Treasury. Treasury securities are one of the safest investments, e.g., defacto risk-free, because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Thus, treasury securities are a mechanism used by the United States government to borrow money, from bond holders, with a fixed set of repayment terms. 

In this lecture, we will discuss three types of treasury securities:

## Treasury Bills, Notes and Bonds
A fixed-income debt security is a contract between a borrower and a lender. In the context of this lecture, 
we'll focus on U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes and Bonds, which are examples of a goverment debt securities. 
For United States treasury debt instruments, the borrower is the U.S. government; the government issues (i.e., sells) a bond to a lender (you) for some amount of cash. This arrangement obligates the U.S. Treasury to make specified payments to the bondholder (you) on specified dates.

There are several types of U.S. government debt securities. However, they share several similarities:

* U.S. Treasury debt securities have specified term lengths, meaning the duration of the borrowing contract between the borrower and the lender. 
* U.S. Treasury debt securities have a par value, i.e., the face value of the instrument, a price (which may not be the same of the par value) and an interest rate.
* U.S. Treasury debt securities have interest payments (historically called coupons) which pay the lender on some fixed schedule over the term of the debt instrument. 
* Interest income from U.S. Treasury debt securities is exempt from state and local income taxes but subject to federal income taxes.
* You can buy U.S Treasury debt (meaning lend money to the U.S. government) directly from the [United States Treasury via TreasuryDirect](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tbonds_glance.htm), through a bank or broker.


### Treasury Bills
Treasury bills (also called T-bills) are short-term debt instruments sold in terms ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. T-bills are typically sold at a discount from the par amount; rarely they are sold at a price equal to the par amount. When a T-bill matures, you are paid its par amount. 

Treasury bills are issued for terms of 4, 8, 13, 26, and 52 weeks; 4-week, 8-week, 13-week, 26-week, and 52-week bills are auctioned on a regular schedule.  

T-bills are an example of a zero-coupon instrument (no interest payments); thus, T-bills are usually sold at a discount and the difference between the purchase price and the par amount is the interest accrued over the term of the T-bill.

### Treasury Notes
Treasury notes, sometimes called T-notes, are a medium-term debt instrument that earns a fixed rate of interest every six months until maturity. T-notes are issued in terms of 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years. The price of a T-note can be greater than, less than, or equal to the T-note's par value. However, at maturity, the par value of the T-note is paid to the owner of the T-note (lender). 

T-notes are an example of a non-zero coupon debt instrument; thus, the lender receives periodic interest payments over the term of the T-note.

### Treasury Bonds
Treasury Bonds are long-term U.S Treasury debt instruments. Treasury bonds pay a fixed rate of interest every six months (called coupon payments) until maturity of the bond. Bonds are issued in a term of 20 years or 30 years. When a bond matures, the owner is paid the face value of the bond. Bonds can be held until maturity or sold before maturity. 

When a U.S. Treasury bond matures, the U.S government repays the debt by paying the bond’s par value (also called the face value of the bond). The coupon rate of the bond determines the interest payment: The annual payment is the coupon rate times the bond’s par value. The coupon rate, maturity date, and par value of the bond are part of the contract between the issuer, in this case the U.S. government and the bondholder (you).




You can buy Treasury bonds directly from the [United States Treasury via TreasuryDirect](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tbonds_glance.htm), or through a bank or broker.

````{prf:example} U.S. Treasury Bond Maturity Calculation
:label: example-30-year-bond

Consider a U.S. Treasury bond with a par value of B = \$1,000, a coupon rate of 8%, and T = 30-year maturity. 

a) Coupon payments: The coupon rate is quoted as an _annual_ percentage. Thus, the bondholder can expect 0.08$\times$B = \$80 per year (or \$40 per coupon payment) every year for 30-years.
