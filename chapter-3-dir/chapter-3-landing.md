# Unit 3: The Fantastic but Dangerous World of Derivatives, Futures, Hedging and Leverage

## Summary

There are three primary financial instruments for weath creation: equity (i.e., shares of stock), debt (i.e., bonds and mortgages) and derivatives. Each of these instruments have a unique risk reward profile. However, they also share a common trait, at their core they are just _structured relationships_ between a buyer and a seller. For example, fixed-income debt securities e.g., Treasury Bills, Notes and Bonds are just contracts i.e., a relationship between a borrower and a lender. In the case of United States treasury debt instruments, the borrower is the U.S. government and the lender is the investor; the government issues (i.e., sells) a bond to a lender (you) for some cash. Then over time, depending upon the stipulations of the of the debt instrument, the borrow pays back the lender in a specified ways. 

Another type of higher-risk (but higher-reward) investment tool is called an option. Option contracts describe the _potential transfer_ of shares a stock e.g., `MSFT`, `AAPL` or `AMD` between a buyer and a seller. Options contracts are traded on exchanges throughout the world; the [The Chicago Board Options Exchange](https://www.cboe.com) is the largest options exchange in the United States, responsible for approximately 33\% of the daily options trading volume in the United States (27 million contracts are traded each day in the United States). Worldwide, in 2021, there were about 33 billion options contracts traded annually.

Futures contracts, much like options, are agreements between a buyer and a seller to buy (or sell) an asset on a specific date in the future. However, unlike options, futures contracts _require_ the buyer to purchase the underlying asset and the contract seller to sell the asset on a specific future date unless the contract holder's position is closed before the contractâ€™s expiration date. Future contracts can control many underlying assets, agricultural products, currencies, and equities.
Futures contracts are traded on an exchange; the largest exchange on which futures contracts are traded is the [Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)](https://www.cmegroup.com). Worldwide, in 2021, there were about 29 billion futures contracts traded annually, with an approxmate daily volume of 11 million contracts traded on the CBOE.
