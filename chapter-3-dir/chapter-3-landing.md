# Unit 3: The Fantastic but Dangerous World of Derivatives, Futures, Hedging and Leverage

## Summary
Derivatives are one of the three primary financial instrument categories: derivatives, equity (i.e., shares of stock), and debt (i.e., bonds and mortgages). The value of a derivative contract 
is based (partially) upon the value of an underlying asset, e.g., shares of a stock, bonds, currency, commodities such as precious metals, agriculture products, etc. Derivatives are attractive because they offer [leverage](https://www.merrilledge.com/investment-products/options/options-trading-leverage-risk), i.e., a derivative contract can control a unit of asset, e.g., 100 shares of a stock, at a cost that is typically _less_ than the market value of that asset. This allows derivative buyers to pay a relatively small premium for market exposure in relation to the value of the derivative. A derivative buyer can see significant gains from comparatively small percentage moves in the underlying product. However, leverage can also have a considerable downside. For example, if the underlying asset price does not rise or fall as anticipated during the lifetime of the derivative contract, leverage magnifies the investment's percentage loss. Derivatives date back to ancient Greece; the oldest example of a derivative, attested to by Aristotle, was a contract governing the transaction of olives by ancient Greek philosopher Thales [REFHERE]. 

Options, derivatives that use equity, i.e., shares of a stock or an exchange-traded fund, as their underlying asset, 
are structured agreements between a buyer and a seller that give
the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to execute the transaction described in the contract, i.e., to buy (or sell) an underlying asset in some predetermined way in a specified time frame.
Investors can use options to [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) against future asset price movements or for speculation. For example, a trader can buy options instead of shares of the underlying stock to generate profits from the underlying stock's price movements, typically at a lower cost than the corresponding block of shares. Options contracts are traded on exchanges throughout the world; the [The Chicago Board Options Exchange](https://www.cboe.com) is the 
largest options exchange in the United States, responsible for approximately 33\% of the daily options trading volume in the United States (27 million contracts are traded each day in the United States). Worldwide, in 2021, there were about 33 billion options contracts traded annually.

Futures contracts, much like options, are agreements between a buyer and a seller to buy (or sell) an asset on a specific date in the future. However, unlike options, futures contracts _require_ the buyer to purchase the underlying asset and the contract seller to sell the asset on a specific future date unless the contract holder's position is closed before the contractâ€™s expiration date. Future contracts can control many underlying assets, agricultural products, currencies, and equities.
Futures contracts are traded on an exchange; the largest exchange on which futures contracts are traded is the [Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)](https://www.cmegroup.com). Worldwide, in 2021, there were about 29 billion futures contracts traded annually, with an approxmate daily volume of 11 million contracts traded on the CBOE.
