# Unit 3: The Fantastic but Dangerous World of Derivatives, Futures, Hedging and Leverage

## Summary



Futures contracts, much like options, are agreements between a buyer and a seller to buy (or sell) an asset on a specific date in the future. However, unlike options, futures contracts _require_ the buyer to purchase the underlying asset and the contract seller to sell the asset on a specific future date unless the contract holder's position is closed before the contractâ€™s expiration date. Future contracts can control many underlying assets, agricultural products, currencies, and equities.
Futures contracts are traded on an exchange; the largest exchange on which futures contracts are traded is the [Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)](https://www.cmegroup.com). Worldwide, in 2021, there were about 29 billion futures contracts traded annually, with an approxmate daily volume of 11 million contracts traded on the CBOE.
