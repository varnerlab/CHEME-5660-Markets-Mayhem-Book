* [Random variables and probability](./random.md) are central concepts in understanding uncertainty.  Random variables represent quantities that can take on different values with a particular probability distribution. They are used to model uncertainty and randomness in various fields, including finance, physics, and engineering. Probability theory provides a framework for understanding and quantifying the likelihood of different events occurring based on the underlying distribution of the random variables involved.
