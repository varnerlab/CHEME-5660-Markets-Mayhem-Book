# Unit 4: Decisions
The objective of this unit is to introduce tools for quantitave descion making. Decision-making can be difficult because it involves balancing the potential outcomes of different actions and choosing the most likely to lead to a desirable result. Further, decisions must often be made in the face of uncertainty. Thus, the decision problem is essential in statistics, economics, engineering, and computer science. 

In this unit, we discuss some of the key concepts and classic problems that are related to decision problems:
<!-- 
* [Probability](./probability-random-variables.md) is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 representing an impossible event and 1 representing a particular event. Probability can be used to help make decisions when the outcomes of a decision are uncertain. -->

* [A Markov decision process (MDP)](./mdp.md) is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where the outcomes are uncertain. It consists of a set of states, actions, and rewards and a probabilistic transition function that determines the next state given the current state and action. MDPs are used to model and solve optimization problems where an agent must make decisions to maximize some reward or utility. They are commonly used in artificial intelligence and control theory to design optimal policies for decision-making problems.

* [A multi-arm bandit problem is a reinforcement learning problem](./rl.md) where an agent is faced with the dilemma of balancing exploration and exploitation. The agent must choose which action to take from a set of options, each with its unknown reward probability. The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward by selecting the action with the highest expected reward. Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique involving an agent learning through trial and error by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. It can be used to solve multi-arm bandit problems and other types of sequential decision-making problems.
