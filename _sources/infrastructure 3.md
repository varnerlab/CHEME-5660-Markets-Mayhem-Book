# CHEME 5660: Financial Data, Markets, and Mayhem

## Description 
Finance plays a crucial role in both technological advancement and the lives of individuals in our society. However, financial forecasting, modeling, and decision-making are rarely taught in traditional engineering or physical science curriculums. Further, an increasing number of engineers and scientists are turning to careers in finance and consulting. Finally, despite advancements in market access, many individuals still need help accessing the wealth-creation opportunities offered by financial systems. To address these gaps, this course introduces engineers and scientists to financial systems, markets, and analytical tools for economic and business operations. Using engineering, statistics, data science, and machine learning, we will model, analyze, and optimize financial systems and decision-making processes. The course material can be applied to both traditional economic and engineering fields.

### Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Analyze financial data sets using tools from statistics, data science (DS) and machine learning (ML)
* Identify quantitative models of asset pricing and process performance using historical and real-time financial data sets 
* Demonstrate mastery of quantitative decision-making and risk management approaches in the context of corporate finance and personal wealth management.

### Topics

We believe there is a compelling opportunity for scientists and engineers to leverage their proficiency in mathematical modeling, optimization, and process control, combined with data science and machine learning tools, to optimize financial decision-making, drive value creation within businesses, and ultimately democratize wealth creation.

### Prerequisites
There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, general familiarity with common programming languages such as Python/Matlab/Julia and mathematical and computing topics such as probability, statistics, optimization, and data science tools such as Jupyter notebooks, DataFrames, etc., will be helpful.

## Grading 
Grades will be computed from 2 take-home prelims (dates/times indicated on the course calendar), a final group project (scheduled by the University), and a participation score. The take-home prelims are collectively worth 60%, while the group project is worth 30% of your final grade. Class participation and other designated assignments will collectively account for 10% of your final grade.  

| Percentage | Component |
| ----------: | --------- |
| 10%	| __Participation__. Course participation (code reviews, questions and TA/course evaluations) will be an important component of the course. Participation opportunities will be identified throughout the semester. |
| 60%	| __Take-home exams__. Two take-home examinations will be distributed. The distribution date will be announced ahead of time, and once distributed, students will have a specified number of hours (at least 36 hours) to complete the exams. |
| 30%	| __Final project__. Development of a research project by each student (semester long with additional emphasis during the final 5 weeks of the course). The projects will conclude with a written report and an oral presentation to the class near the end of the semester. The final written reports will be due on the University assigned date for final projects. |

This course will have weekly hands-on case studies completed as teams in the discussion section(s). We expect everyone to attempt every case study and to participate in the discussion section:

* The teaching team reserves the right to collect and grade entire case studies or specific questions of case studies throughout the course.
* Teamwork is welcome (and encouraged) on case studies and course projects, but the take-home exams must be completed individually. 

## Course policies 
Scientists and engineers are responsible for maintaining a very high degree of professional integrity in their work. As a student, this means strictly adhering to the Cornell Code of Academic Integrity and the specific policies detailed in your courses.  Please review Cornell’s academic integrity policy if you are not already familiar with it. 

For this course, the specific rules are as follows:

* Cooperation: You may discuss/complete problem sets with classmates, but all submitted work (should there be any) must be your own. Prelims must be completed individually without the help of students, teaching assistants, faculty, and other sources. 

* Submissions: all required submissions (should there be any) must be submitted to the teaching team email: [course email goes here]. Each submission should include your name(s) or netID(s) on the first page of the assignment. Except for computer code, submissions should consist of a single PDF document generated using LaTeX. 

* Re-grade requests: Prelim re-grade requests must be submitted in writing within two weeks of their return. The entire prelim will be re-graded in addition to addressing any requested issues. 

* Computing: The course will officially support numerical computing in the Julia programming language. You can use other numerical computing tools (e.g., Matlab/Octave, Python/NumPy), but support will be limited to Julia. Julia is free and can be downloaded from: https://julialang.org.

* For any computing assignments, you may be required to publish code to GitHub or submit files to Gradescope; in these cases, specific instructions and procedures will be given.  

### Disabilities Statement
If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, provide Prof. Varner with an accommodation letter from Student Disability Services. Students are expected to give two weeks’ notice of the need for accommodations.

### Diversity Statement
We aspire to create an environment for learning, intellectual discourse, and professional and social interactions where every individual feels welcome and valued. We recognize all course participants as responsible adults with differing perspectives based, in part, on their unique experiences. We espouse the broader mission and values of the Smith School as described here: https://www.cheme.cornell.edu/cbe/about/mission.
