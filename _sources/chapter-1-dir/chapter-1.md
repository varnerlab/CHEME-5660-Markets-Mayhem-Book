# Unit 1: The Basics of Assets, Money, Markets and the Global Financial System

## Summary
This chapter introduces assets, markets, the notion of money, and the global financial system. 
We think about assets as tangible items, e.g., cars, houses, etc. These are certainly examples of
physical, tangible assets. However, assets are more general than just material items. For example, intellectual 
property, e.g., patents or other non-physical things such as a manufacturing process, are also assets. 
Thus, a more general notion of an asset is simply a flow of money; but what is money? Money is an economic unit that functions as a generally recognized medium of exchange for transactional purposes in an economy. Money is itself an asset used in the settlement of transactions between a buyer and a seller.
