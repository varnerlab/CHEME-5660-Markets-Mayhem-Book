    "## Introduction\n",
    "[Julia](https://julialang.org) is a dynamically typed compiled programming language developed at [MIT](https://julia.mit.edu) for general purpose computing. [Julia](https://julialang.org) has a number of interesting features, and is an [open source project available under the MIT license](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia). \n",
    "\n",

    "## The Julia REPL\n",
    "You interact with [Julia](https://julialang.org) through the [Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL)](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/). The [REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) allows for quick and easy evaluation of [Julia](https://julialang.org) commands; it has a searchable history, tab-completion, many helpful keybindings, and dedicated help and shell modes. The REPL can be started by launching Julia from the [Terminal on macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac) or [by installing Windows Subsystem for Linux and launching Julia from an xterm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), or by double-clicking on the [Julia](https://julialang.org) executable, or finally by starting [Julia](https://julialang.org) from the command line in the [terminal of VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the [REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) is started, there are __four__ possible modes that it can be in: \n",
    "\n",
    "* [Julian mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#The-Julian-mode): Default mode where commands and expressions are evaluated.\n",
    "* [Help mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Help-mode): Launches the Julia ``help system mode`` where users can view documenation about functions or other Julia features.\n",
    "* [Shell mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#man-shell-mode): Launches the ``shell mode`` which allows users to interact with the operating system shell. For Windows users, Julia's shell mode does not expose windows shell commands.\n",
    "* [Package mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode): Launches the [Julia package manager](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/) which allows users to add or delete external packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through each of these modes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Julian mode\n",
    "The [Julian REPL mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#The-Julian-mode) is the default mode of operation; each new line initially starts with the ``julia>`` prompt. [Julia](https://julialang.org) commands are entered at the prompt and the results are printed to the screen; hitting return or enter after a complete expression has been entered at the prompt will evaluate the entry and show the result of the last expression. \n",

    "## Julia types, functions and syntax\n",
    "Julia is a just-in-time compiled language (which gives it a runtime advantage over other popular interpreted languages). However, unlike other languages such as `C`, Julia code is compiled when you run it; a separate compile step is unnecessary. Thus, Julia gives the convenience and performance of a compiled language without the burden of manual compilation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, Julia is a dynamically-typed language. This means you are not required to declare the type of variables before you use them. Instead, when your Julia code is compiled, the compiler uses sophisticated logic to infer, i.e., guess your data types. However, users can also specify types, potentially lessening the compiler’s burden. Further, many users find codes with the types annotated to be easier to read and maintain; remember, you may be supporting codes for _decades_, thus, making them easy to understand has an upside.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable types\n",
    "Variables are values that you tell your computer to associate with a specific name so that you can later recover or change their values.  Variables can be of different types; [Julia](https://julialang.org) has an extensive [type system](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/). However, in this course we will primarily use [floating point numbers](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/integers-and-floating-point-numbers/#Floating-Point-Numbers), [integers](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/integers-and-floating-point-numbers/#Integers) and [Strings](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/strings/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Julia](https://julialang.org), we do not have to declare a variable name or specify the variable type as in other languages such as `C`; we can just set the variable, and the compiler will figure out the rest. For example, suppose we wanted to store a floating point value (of type `Float64`) in the variable `x`:"
