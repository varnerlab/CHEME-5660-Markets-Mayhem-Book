# American and European style option contracts
There are two types of options contracts, a CALL contract and a PUT contract, and two different styles of contracts that we'll consider American and European style contracts. A CALL contract gives the 
buyer the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 shares (per contract) of an underlying stock, `XYZ`, at a price per share called the strike price of $K$. On the other hand, a PUT contract gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to sell 100 shares (per contract) of an underlying stock, `XYZ`, at a strike price of $K$ per share. For European-style contracts, the transaction codified in CALL or PUT contracts can only occur at some fixed date in the future called the expiration date, which is agreed upon when the contract is purchased. However, American contract styles have a different policy; American contracts can be exercised (the buyer can initiate the transaction) at any time between when the contract was purchased up to the expiration date.
