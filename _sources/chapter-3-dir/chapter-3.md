# The Fantastic but Dangerous World of Derivatives, Futures, and Leverage

## Introduction to Derivatives
A Derivative is a financial contract that derives its value based (partially) upon the value of an underlying asset, e.g., shares of a stock, bonds, currency, commodities such as precious metals, agriculture products, etc. Derivatives have a long history, dating back to ancient Greece; the oldest example of a derivative, attested to by Aristotle, was a contract governing the transaction of olives by ancient Greek philosopher Thales [REFHERE]. Derivatives are one of the three main categories of financial instruments, the other two being equity (i.e., shares of stock) and debt (i.e., bonds and mortgages). 

Equity derivatives (hereafter referred to as options), which use shares of a stock or exchange-traded fund as the underlying asset, are a significant derivative class. Options can be used by investors to 
[hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) against price movements, or then can also be used for speculation purposes. For example, a trader can buy options, instead of actual stock, to generate profits from the underlying asset's price movements.
