# The Fantastic but Dangerous World of Derivatives, Futures, and Leverage

## Introduction to Derivatives
A Derivative is a financial contract that derives its value based (partially) upon the value of an underlying asset, e.g., shares of a stock, bonds, currency, commodities such as precious metals, agriculture products, etc. Derivatives are one of the three main categories of financial instruments, the other two being equity (i.e., shares of stock) and debt (i.e., bonds and mortgages). Equity derivatives (hereafter referred to as options), where the underlying asset is shares of a stock or exchange-traded fund, are a significant derivative class. Derivatives have a long history, dating back to ancient Greece; the oldest example of a derivative in history, attested to by Aristotle, was a contact transaction of olives by ancient Greek philosopher Thales [REFHERE].
