    "## Introduction\n",
    "Probability is many things to many people. \n",
    "[Frequentists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability) argue that probability is the relative frequency or propensity of a particular outcome in the set of all possible outcomes. For example, if you flip a fair coin infinitely many times, you expect to get heads about half the time (assuming a fair coin). On the other hand, [Bayesians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability) argue that probability is a subjective belief. For example, the probability of getting an A in a class is subjective because no one can take a class infinitely many times to obtain the relative frequency. The context of your problem will typically suggest which perspective to use. For example, when you have a shortage of data, a Bayesian approach allows you to use prior knowledge or belief. On the other hand, when in a data-rich environment, a [frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability) approach calculates the probability of an event directly from the data, along with confidence intervals on your estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, whether you prefer the [frequentist’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability) or the [Bayesian view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability), there is a more fundamental notion of probability thanks to [Andrey Kolmogorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov), namely, the probability is a measure of the size of a set. \n",

    "In mathematics, we are often interested in describing a collection of numbers or other mathematical objects, for example, the numbers $\\left[a, b\\right]$ on the real line, or the ordered pairs of numbers that define a circle. These collections of numbers can be abstractly defined as sets. \n",
    "A set is simply a collection of mathematical objets. Set theory is a mathematical tool that defines operations on sets. It provides the basic arithmetic for combining, separating, and decomposing sets.\n",

    "To denote that an object $a$ belongs to the set $A$, we write $a\\in{A}$. \n",

    "we write $1\\in\\left\\{1, 2, 3,\\dots,10\\right\\}$. The elements of sets can be anything; real numbers, complex numbers, functions or any mathematical object.\n",
