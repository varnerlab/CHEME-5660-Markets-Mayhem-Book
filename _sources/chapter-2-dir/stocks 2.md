# Equity Securities
Equity securities are financial assets that represent ownership in a company. They trade on stock exchanges and can provide long-term gains and dividend income, but also carry risks due to market price fluctuations. Equity securities are often used as a component of an investor's portfolio because they offer the potential for higher returns compared to other types of investments such as bonds or cash.
