# Equity Securities

## Introduction
Common stocks, also known as equity securities or equities, represent ownership shares in a corporation. Each share of common stock entitles its owner to one vote on any matters of corporate governance that are put to the vote at the corporation’s annual meeting and a share in the financial benefits of ownership. The corporation is controlled by a board of directors elected by the shareholders. The board meets a few times per year and selects the management team that runs the corporation daily. Managers have the authority to make most business decisions without the board’s specific approval. The board’s mandate is to oversee the management to ensure that it acts in the best interests of shareholders.

The two most important characteristics of common stock as an investment are its residual claim and limited liability features:

* Residual claim means that stockholders are the last in line of all those who have a claim on the assets and income of the corporation. In liquidating the firm’s assets, the shareholders have a claim to what is left after all other claimants, such as the tax authorities, employees, suppliers, bondholders, and other creditors, have been paid. For a firm not in liquidation, shareholders have a claim to the part of operating income left over after interest and taxes have been paid. Management can either pay this residual as cash dividends to shareholders or reinvest it in the business to increase the value of the shares. 

* Limited liability means the most shareholders can lose in the event of the corporation’s failure is their original investment. Unlike owners of unincorporated businesses, whose creditors can lay claim to the personal assets of the owner (house, car, furniture), corporate shareholders may, at worst, have worthless stock. They are not personally liable for the firm’s obligations.
