# Finance and Markets for Engineers and Scientists

## Description 
Finance plays a crucial role in both technological advancement and the lives of individuals in our society. However, financial forecasting, modeling, and decision-making are rarely taught in traditional engineering or physical science curriculums. Further, an increasing number of engineers and scientists are turning to careers in finance and consulting. Finally, despite advancements in market access, many individuals still need help accessing the wealth-creation opportunities offered by financial systems. To address these gaps, this course introduces engineers and scientists to financial systems, markets, and analytical tools for economic and business operations. Using engineering, statistics, data science, and machine learning, we will model, analyze, and optimize financial systems and decision-making processes. The course material can be applied to both traditional economic and engineering fields.

### Topics
Lectures are organized into units, each unit having roughly four weeks of class time:

* [Unit 1. Financial Basics](./chapter-1-dir/chapter-1-landing.md) will introduce the basics of financial systems, markets, and instruments. We'll also introduce the basics of financial accounting and financial statements.
* [Unit 2: Tools for Wealth Creation](./chapter-2-dir/chapter-2-landing.md) will introduce the basics of wealth creation, including analyzing fixed-income, equity, and derivative assets and computing the risk and return of various assets.
* [Unit 3: Modern Portfolio Theory](./chapter-3-dir/chapter-3-landing.md) will introduce the basics of portfolio management, including analyzing portfolio risk and return and constructing optimal portfolios.
* [Unit 4: Financial Decision Theory](./chapter-4-dir/chapter-4-landing.md) will introduce the basics of financial decision theory, including analyzing rational decision-making under uncertainty and using Markov processes and reinforcement learning to model sequential decision-making.

### Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
* __Outcome 1__: Analyze financial data sets using tools from statistics, data science (DS) and machine learning (ML)
* __Outcome 2__: Identify quantitative models of asset pricing and process performance using historical and real-time financial data sets 
* __Outcome 3__: Demonstrate mastery of quantitative decision-making and risk management approaches in the context of corporate finance and personal wealth management.

### Prerequisites
There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, general familiarity with common programming languages such as Python/Matlab/Julia and mathematical and computing topics such as probability, statistics, optimization, and data science tools such as Jupyter notebooks, DataFrames, etc., will be helpful.

## Grading 
Grades will be computed from 3 $\times$ take-home prelims (dates/times indicated on the course calendar), a final group project (scheduled by the University), and a participation score. The take-home prelims are collectively worth 60%, while the group project is worth 30% of your final grade. Class participation and other designated assignments will collectively account for 10% of your final grade.  

| Percentage | Component |
| ----------: | --------- |
| 10%	| __Participation__. Course participation (code reviews, questions and TA/course evaluations) will be an important component of the course. Participation opportunities will be identified throughout the semester. |
| 60%	| __Take-home exams__. Three take-home examinations will be distributed. The distribution date will be announced ahead of time, and once distributed, students will have a specified number of hours (at least 36 hours) to complete the exams. |
| 30%	| __Final project__. Development of a research project by each student (semester long with additional emphasis during the final 5 weeks of the course). The projects will conclude with a written report and an oral presentation to the class near the end of the semester. The final written reports will be due on the University assigned date for final projects. |

This course will have weekly hands-on case studies completed as teams in the discussion section(s). We expect everyone to attempt every case study and to participate in the discussion section:

* The teaching team reserves the right to collect and grade entire case studies or specific questions of case studies throughout the course.
* Teamwork is welcome (and encouraged) on case studies and course projects, but the take-home exams must be completed individually. 

## Course policies and procedures
* Students must know and abide by Cornell’s Code of Academic Integrity. You may discuss problem sets with classmates, but all submitted work should be yours. Take-home exams must be completed individually without the help of students, teaching assistants, faculty, and other sources. [Please review Cornell’s academic integrity policy](http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html)
* Late problem sets: 25% will be deducted from your grade each day the homework assignment is late. Homework regrade requests should be submitted in writing within two weeks of the assignment’s return.
* Exam re-grade requests must be submitted in writing within one week of the return of the exam document. The entire exam document will be re-graded in addition to addressing the re-grade request. 
* If you need to request an extension on a problem set because of an extenuating circumstance, please get in touch with Professor Varner before the problem set is due to discuss an extension. 
* All required submissions (should there be any) must include your name(s) or netID(s) on the first page of the assignment. Except for computer code, written submissions should consist of a single PDF document generated using the LaTeX document preparation system. For any computing assignments, you may be required to publish code to GitHub or submit files to Gradescope; in these cases, specific instructions and procedures will be given.
* This course will officially support numerical computing in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org). You can use other numerical computing tools (e.g., Matlab/Octave, Python/NumPy), but support will be limited to [Julia](https://julialang.org). We’ll use [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com) as our Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Disabilities statement
If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, please provide Professor Varner with an accommodation letter from [Student Disability Services](https://sds.cornell.edu). Students are expected to give two weeks’ notice of the need for accommodations.  

## Diversity statement
We aspire to create an environment for learning, intellectual discourse, and professional and social interactions where everyone feels welcome and valued. We recognize all course participants as responsible adults with differing perspectives based partly on their unique experiences. [We espouse the broader mission and values of the Smith School](https://www.cheme.cornell.edu/cbe/about/mission).
