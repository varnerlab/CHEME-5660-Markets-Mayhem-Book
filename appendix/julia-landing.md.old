# Getting Started with Julia

In this course, we will use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org) for all lecture examples and most of the discussion section problems. [Julia](https://julialang.org) is open source, accessible, and runs on all major platforms (macOS, Windows, and Linux). In this chapter, we discuss how to get started with [Julia](https://julialang.org) and [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com), the integrated development environment (IDE) that we will use to compose and execute our [Julia](https://julialang.org) programs. 

In particular, we will:
* [Dicuss the installation of Julia and VSCode](./julia-installation.md)
* [Introduce Julia types, functions and basic syntax](./julia-basics.md)
* [Packages and patterns for working with data](./julia-data.md)
