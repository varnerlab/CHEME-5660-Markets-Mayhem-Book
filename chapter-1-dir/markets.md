# Markets and Exchanges

## Introduction
Markets are _places_ (perhaps physical locations such as a retail outlet or virtual sites on the internet) where parties exchange (trade) goods and services. In a physical market, buyers and sellers meet face-to-face, while there is no physical contact between buyers and sellers in a virtual market. Thus, a market is any _place_ where two or more parties engage in an economic transaction, i.e., the exchange of goods, services, information, currency, or any combination that passes from one party to another. While only two parties are needed to make a trade, an efficient market is characterized by many active buyers and sellers. 

An exchange is a market where financial instruments such as [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp), [commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), or [derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/derivative.asp) are traded. An exchange ensures fair and orderly trading and the efficient dissemination of price information for securities traded on that exchange. Thus, exchanges give companies, governments, and other groups a platform to sell securities to the investing public (you!). Different products can be traded on different exchanges.
For example, for [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp), there are [sixteen exchanges in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_exchanges) that have a market capitalization of over US $1 trillion each. These exchanges account for approximately 87\% of global market capitalization. On the other hand, [derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/derivative.asp) are traded on option exchanges such as the [Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)](https://www.cboe.com).

Exchanges can be organized in a variety of ways. Before the widespread adaption of electronic exchanges, 
[the open outcry system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_outcry) was used where professionals on the exchange shouted and used hand signals to communicate information about buy and sell orders; the trading floor where this took place was called _the pit_. However, since the 1980s, open outcry systems have been mainly replaced by electronic trading systems 
such as the [Computer Assisted Trading System (CATS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATS_(trading_system)) or the 
[Globex trading system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globex_Trading_System). In electronic trading systems, buyers and sellers may be separated by thousands of miles. Thus, electronic trading platforms are computer software that allows users to place orders for financial products over a network from mobile devices, websites, or even Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

At the center of electronic exchanges are pieces of software called [matching engines](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/trading-and-matching-technology). Matching engines match the buyers of a financial instrument with the sellers of that instrument. Thus, matching engines play an essential role in defining the price dynamics of the various financial instruments traded on an exchange.

<!-- The market establishes the prices for goods and other services. These rates are determined by supply and demand. Supply is created by the sellers, while demand is generated by buyers. Markets try to find some balance in price when supply and demand are themselves in balance. But that balance can in itself be disrupted by factors other than price including incomes, expectations, technology, the cost of production, and the number of buyers and sellers participating. -->

## Structure and Dynamics of Double Auctions
A [double auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_auction) is a process of buying and selling goods that involves multiple sellers and buyers simultaneously. In a double auction, potential buyers submit _bids_ which specify the quantity and price the buyer wishes to buy the good or service at, while potential sellers submit _asks_ which describe the quanitity and price of the good or service they wish to sell. Then the _market institution_ chooses some price $p>0$ that clears the market i.e., all the sellers who asked less than or equal to $p$ sell while all buyers who bid greater than to equal to $p$ buy at price $p$. A common example of a double auction is an electronic stock or options exchange.

The interesting question of a [double auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_auction) is how the _market institution_ chooses the clearing price $p$.
