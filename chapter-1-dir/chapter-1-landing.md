# Unit 1: Assets, Money and Markets

The objective of this unit is to introduce the essential components of personal finance, markets, and assets:

* [Personal finance basics](./pfinance-basics.md). We start the course by introducing key concepts such as budgets, balance sheets, and the idea of needs versus wants that we build upon for later.
* [Most of us think about assets](./assets.md) as tangible items, e.g., cars, houses, etc. These are certainly examples of physical, tangible assets. However, assets are more general than just material items. For example, intellectual property, e.g., patents or other non-physical things such as a manufacturing process, are also assets. Thus, a more general notion of an asset is simply a flow of money; what is money? Money is an economic unit that functions as a generally recognized medium of exchange for transactional purposes in an economy. Money is an asset used to settle transactions between a buyer and a seller. 
* [Markets](./markets.md) are _places_ (perhaps physical locations such as a retail store or virtual sites on the internet) where parties exchange (trade) goods and services. In a physical market, buyers and sellers meet face-to-face, while there is no physical contact between buyers and sellers in a virtual market. Thus, a market is any _place_ where two or more parties engage in an economic transaction, i.e., the exchange of goods, services, information, currency, or any combination that passes from one party to another.
