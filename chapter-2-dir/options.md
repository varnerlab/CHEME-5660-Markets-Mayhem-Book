# Derivative Securities
Financial instruments are classified into three categories: derivatives, equity, and debt. Derivatives offer payoffs that are derived from the value of underlying assets like stocks, commodities, bonds, or market indexes. 

 <!-- These agreements give the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to execute the transaction described in the contract at a specific time, such as buying (or selling) the underlying asset in a predetermined way within a specified timeframe. -->

```{topic} Outline
In this set of lectures, we focus on options. Like bonds, options are contractual agreements between buyers and sellers for a particular transaction at a later date. However, unlike bonds, options are derivatives, which means that their value is derived from the value of an underlying asset.

* [American and European Call and Put Contracts](content:references:american-european-options-contracts) are agreements between a buyer and a seller that use equity (shares of a stock or an exchange-traded fund) as their underlying asset. Call contracts give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified timeframe, while Put contracts grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified timeframe.

* [Call and Put contracts can be combined](content:references:american-options-composite-contracts) to develop composite trade structures with interesting payoff and profit properties. Here, we initially limit our focus to contracts that have the same underlying asset and the same expiration date.
