# Modeling and Analysis of Asset Price Dynamics

## Summary
This chapter develops methods for simulating various [stochastic processes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYI5xKlH_MU) that are important to mathematical finance. We begin with a refresher on [probability and random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable). We then introduce [Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) and [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) models, and the modern portfolio approach pioneered by Markowitz {cite}`MPT1952`. Finally, we conclude by exploring different stochastic models of asset price dynamics, particularly [Geometric Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion) models.
