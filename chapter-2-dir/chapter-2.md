# Unit 2: Modeling and Analysis of Asset Price Dynamics

## Summary
In this unit, we develop methods for simulating types of random processes called
[stochastic processes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYI5xKlH_MU) are essential to mathematical finance. We begin with a refresher on [probability and random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable). We then introduce [Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) and its application to simulate stochastic models of asset price dynamics, particularly [Geometric Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion) models. Finally, we introduce microscopic market models, agent-based models,  of financial markets that connect individual behavior and psychology with market dynamics.

At the end of this unit, students should be able to understand:
