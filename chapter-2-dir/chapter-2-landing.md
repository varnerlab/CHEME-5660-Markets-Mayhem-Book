# Wealth Creation
Wealth creation using bonds, stocks, and options is an important aspect of investment management. Bonds are debt securities that provide a fixed income to investors, while stocks represent ownership in a company and offer the potential for capital gains and dividends. Options are financial instruments that give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price and time. These tools can be used in combination to create a diversified investment portfolio that balances risk and reward. By understanding the characteristics and risks associated with each asset class, investors can make informed decisions to maximize their wealth creation potential.

* [US Treasury debt instruments](./bonds.md) are financial securities issued by the US government to finance its operations and manage the national debt. These instruments include Treasury bills (T-bills), Treasury notes (T-notes), and Treasury bonds (T-bonds), each with varying maturities ranging from a few days to 30 years. They are considered to be among the safest investments in the world due to the US government's creditworthiness, and are widely used by investors as a low-risk component of their investment portfolios.
* [Stocks](./equity.md) also known as equities, represent ownership in a company and are one of the most common types of financial securities traded in the stock market. By purchasing stocks, investors can become part owners of the company and potentially earn returns through capital appreciation and/or dividends. Stocks are typically considered to be higher-risk investments due to their price volatility, but they also offer the potential for higher returns compared to lower-risk assets such as bonds or cash.
* [Options](./contracts.md) are derivative securities that give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price and time. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as hedging against price fluctuations, generating income through option premiums, or speculating on market movements. Options can be classified as either call options or put options, and can be further categorized based on factors such as their expiration date, strike price, and underlying asset. -->
