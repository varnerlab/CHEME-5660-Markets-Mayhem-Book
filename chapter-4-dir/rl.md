# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

## Introduction
In our discussion of [Markov decision process (MDPs)](./mdp.md), we assumed that the transition and reward models were known precisely. However, these models may not be discovered in many actual problems. In these cases, the agent must learn to act through experience, e.g., by observing the outcomes of its actions. Then the agent chooses actions that maximize its long-term accumulation of reward. 

Several challenges must be addressed in cases of uncertain models. First, agents must balance between exploring the world and exploiting knowledge gained through experience. Second, rewards may be received long after decisions have been made. Finally, agents must generalize from limited experience. 

In this lecture, we will explore these three challenges. In particular, we will:

* Introduce the {ref}`content:references:basic-concepts-reinforcement-learning` and contrast reinforcement learning with [Markov Decision Processes](./mdp.md) and other machine learning approaches. 
* Introduce {ref}`content:references:model-based-reinforcement-learning` in which the decision-making agent iteratively builds a model for the world
* Introduce {ref}`content:references:model-free-reinforcement-learning` in which an agent builds a policy directly from interacting with the world

## Basic concepts of reinforcement learning
[Reinforcement Learning (RL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) agents learn by performing actions in the world and then analyzing the rewards they receive ({numref}`fig-rl-schematic`). Thus, reinforcement learning differs from other machine learning approaches, e.g., [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) because labeled input/output pairs, e.g., what actions lead to positive rewards are not presented to the agent _a priori_.  Instead, reinforcement learning agents learn what is good or bad by trying different actions. 

Reinforcement learning agents learn optimal choices in different situations by balancing the exploration of their environment, e.g., by taking random actions and watching what happens, with the exploitation of the knowledge they have built up so far, i.e., choosing what the agent thinks is an optimal action based upon previous experience. The balance between exploration versus exploitation is one of the key concepts in reinforcement learning.

### Exploration, exploitation and bandit problems
Reinforcement learning agents must balance exploration of the environment, e.g., taking random actions with exploiting knowledge already obtained through interacting with the world. Pure exploration allows agents to construct a comprehensive model of their environment, but likely at the expense of positive reward. On the other hand, pure exploitation has the agent continually choosing the action it thinks best to accumulate reward, but different, better actions could be taken. 

A classic approach to understanding the exploration and exploitation tradeoff, which itself has many real-world applications, is the [multi arm bandit problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit). A general bandit problem is a sequential game played between an agent and the environment. The game is played over $n$ rounds called the _horizon_. In each round the agent chooses an action $a\in\mathcal{A}$ and the environment then reveals a reward $r$. 

Let's look at a particular sub-type of multi-arm bandit problem, namely, the Bernoulli bandit problem and Thompson sampling, a particular solution approach to this class of problem {cite}`RUSSO-2017-TS`:

````{prf:definition} Binary Bernoulli bandit problem
:label: defn-multi-arm-bernoulli-bandit-problem

Suppose an agent has a choice between $K$ possible actions $\mathcal{A}=\left\{a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{K}\right\}$. Further, the success or failure of any action $a_{i}\in\mathcal{A}$ is governed by a Bernoulli random variable (see {prf:ref}`defn-pmf-bernouli`); $R_{a_{i}} = 1$ (sucess) with probability $p_{a_{i}}$, and $R_{a_{i}} = 0$ (failure) otherwise. 

The success probabilities of any action $p_{a_{i}}$, while static over the horizon of the game, are unknown to the agent, but they can be learned by experimentation. The agentâ€™s objective is to maximize the cumulative number of successes over the game horizon, e.g., T-periods, where $T\gg{K}$. 

````

There are multiple heuristic strategies to solve the Binary Bernoulli bandit problem described in {prf:ref}`defn-multi-arm-bernoulli-bandit-problem`:

* [Thompson sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling) which is shown in {prf:ref}`algo-thompson-sampling` consists of choosing the action that maximizes the expected reward with respect to a randomly drawn belief, where the belief distribution follows a [Beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution). 

```{prf:algorithm} Thompson-sampling
:label: algo-thompson-sampling

**Inputs**  number of time periods in the horizon $T$, the dimension of the action space $K = |\mathcal{A}|$, and
$\alpha_{1},\dots,\alpha_{K}$ and $\beta_{1},\dots,\beta_{K}$ the initial values (prior) for the parameters that appear in the 
Beta-distribution for each action 

**Outputs** posterior values for the parameters $\alpha_{1},\dots,\alpha_{K}$ and $\beta_{1},\dots,\beta_{K}$ that appear in the Beta-distributions for each action

**Initialize**
a Beta-distribution for each action using initial values $(\alpha,\beta)$.

**Main**
1. for t $\in$ 1 to T
    1. for k $\in$ 1 to K
        1. sample $\hat{\theta}_{k} \sim \beta(\alpha_{k}, \beta_{k})$
    

    1. Select action: $a_{t} = \text{arg}\max_{k}\hat{\theta}_{k}$
    1. Apply $a_{t}$ and observe $r_{t}$.
    1. Update distribution parameters:
        1. $(\alpha_{t},\beta_{t})\leftarrow\left(\alpha_{t}+r_{t},\beta_{t}+(1-r_{t})\right)$

**Return**
$(\alpha_{1},\dots,\alpha_{K})$ and $(\beta_{1},\dots,\beta_{K})$
```

* An obvious (but naive) alternative approach is to allocate a fixed fraction of the time steps in the time horizon, say $\epsilon$, to explore purely random actions. In contrast, in the remaining periods, only successful actions are chosen via [Thompson sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling) or another exploitation approach. This strategy, called $\epsilon$-greedy exploration, is shown in {prf:ref}`algo-e-greedy` with a [Thompson sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling) exploitation step:

```{prf:algorithm} $\epsilon$-greedy exploration
:label: algo-e-greedy

**Inputs**  the pure exploration parameter $\epsilon$, the number of time periods in the horizon $T$, the dimension of the action space $K = |\mathcal{A}|$, and
$\alpha_{1},\dots,\alpha_{K}$ and $\beta_{1},\dots,\beta_{K}$ the initial values (prior) for the parameters that appear in the 
Beta-distribution for each action 

**Outputs** posterior values for the parameters $\alpha_{1},\dots,\alpha_{K}$ and $\beta_{1},\dots,\beta_{K}$ that appear in the Beta-distributions for each action

**Initialize**
a Beta-distribution for each action using initial values $(\alpha,\beta)$.

**Main**
1. for t $\in$ 1 to T
    1. if rand() $<\epsilon$
        1. Select random action: $a_{t}\sim\text{Uniform}(\mathcal{A})$
    1. else
        1. for k $\in$ 1 to K
            1. sample $\hat{\theta}_{k} \sim \beta(\alpha_{k}, \beta_{k})$
    
        1. Select action: $a_{t} = \text{arg}\max_{k}\hat{\theta}_{k}$
    
    1. Apply $a_{t}$ and observe $r_{t}$.
    1. Update distribution parameters:
        1. $(\alpha_{t},\beta_{t})\leftarrow\left(\alpha_{t}+r_{t},\beta_{t}+(1-r_{t})\right)$

**Return**
$(\alpha_{1},\dots,\alpha_{K})$ and $(\beta_{1},\dots,\beta_{K})$
```



Let's consider an example three-arm Binary Bernoulli bandit problem to illustrate the exploration versus explotation trade-off:

````{prf:example} Three-arm binary Bernoulli bandit problem
:label: ex-bbbp

Consider a three-arm binary Bernoulli bandit problem in which the actual success probability for the arms is given by $\theta=\left(0.90, 0.60, 0.80\right)$. Simulation results for algorithms {prf:ref}`algo-thompson-sampling` and {prf:ref}`algo-e-greedy` for a horizon of T = 250 steps are shown in {numref}`fig-bbbp-sim-example`.

The  $\epsilon$-greedy approach for $\epsilon=0.20$ performs better than Thompson sampling alone; in both cases, the actual best action $a_{1}$ is discovered. However, the overlap between competing actions and action $a_{1}$ is smaller in the $\epsilon$-greedy approach for small $\epsilon$. In contrast, as $\epsilon$ becomes larger, the Thompson sampling-only case performs better.

## Model-free reinforcement learning
Unlike {ref}`content:references:model-based-reinforcement-learning`, model-free reinforcement learning does not require us to construct explicit transition and reward models. Instead, model-free methods compute the action value function $Q(s,a)$ directly, e.g., by incrementally estimating the action value function $Q(s,a)$ from samples using the _Q-learning_ approach. 

### Basic Q-learning
The Q-learning approach incrementally estimates the action value function $Q(s,a)$ using the action value form of the _Bellman expectation equation_. 
From our discussion of [Markov decision process (MDPs)](./mdp.md), we know that the action-value function (the $Q$-function) is defined as:

```{math}
Q(s,a) = R(s,a) + \gamma\sum_{s^{\prime}\in\mathcal{S}}T(s^{\prime} | s, a)U(s^{\prime})
```

However, we do know that:

```{math}
U(s) = \max_{a} Q(s,a)
```

thus:

```{math}
:label: eqn-bellman-expectation-eqn
Q(s,a) = R(s,a) + \gamma\sum_{s^{\prime}\in\mathcal{S}}T(s^{\prime} | s, a)\left(\max_{a^{\prime}}Q(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})\right)
```

Here's the catch: in a model-free universe, we don't know the rewards or physics of the world, i.e., we don't know the rewards $R(s,a)$ or the probability array $T(s^{\prime} | s, a)$ that appear in Eqn. {eq}`eqn-bellman-expectation-eqn`. Instead of computing the rewards and transitions from a model we develop, we estimate them from samples received:

```{math}
Q(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_{r,s^{\prime}}\left[r+\gamma\cdot\max_{a^{\prime}}Q(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})\right]
```

#### Incremental Q-table updates
Many model-free methods incrementally estimate the action value function $Q(s, a)$ which is the expectation of reward recieved and the sampled values for the utility. Suppose we are interested in computing the expectation of a single random variable X from $\mathcal{M}$ samples:

```{math}
\hat{x}_{m} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{M}|}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{M}}x_{i}
```

where $|\mathcal{M}|$ denotes the number of samples in the sample set $\mathcal{M}$. However, we can re-write the sum as:

```{math}
\hat{x}_{m} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{M}|}\left(x_{m}+\sum_{i\in\mathcal{M}^{-}}x_{i}\right)
```

where $\mathcal{M}^{-}$ denotes the set of samples with the last sample removed.
