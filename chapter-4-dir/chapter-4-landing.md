# Unit 4: Decisions
In this unit, we explore tools that aid in quantitative decision-making within the realm of finance and wealth management. Making decisions can be challenging as it requires assessing the potential outcomes of different actions and selecting the most promising option to achieve a favorable outcome. Additionally, decisions often need to be made in the midst of uncertainty. Therefore, the decision-making process is a crucial aspect of statistics, economics, engineering, and computer science.

In this unit, we will discuss the following topics:

<!-- 
* [Probability](./probability-random-variables.md) is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 representing an impossible event and 1 representing a particular event. Probability can be used to help make decisions when the outcomes of a decision are uncertain. -->

* [Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMM)](./markov.md) are useful for financial decision-making, allowing us to analyze complex systems with temporal dependencies. They help us predict future behavior and uncover patterns, leading to more informed choices based on probabilistic forecasts.

* [A Markov decision process (MDP)](./mdp) is a mathematical tool used for modeling decision-making in uncertain situations. It comprises a group of states, actions, rewards, and a probabilistic transition function that governs the next state based on the present state and action. MDPs are employed to model and solve optimization challenges where an agent must make decisions that maximize rewards or utility. They are extensively used in artificial intelligence and control theory to create optimal policies for decision-making issues.

* [The multiarm bandit problem](./bandits.md) is a type of decision-making challenge that arises in various fields, including clinical trials, online advertising, and recommendation systems. In the multiarm bandit problem, a decision-maker must allocate resources to a set of actions (or “arms”) with unknown reward distributions, aiming to maximize the total reward during a fixed time period. This challenge is complex because the decision-maker must balance between exploiting arms that have previously shown high rewards and exploring new arms that may have higher rewards.

* [Reinforcement learning](./rl.md) is a machine learning method that involves an agent learning through trial and error by interacting with its surroundings and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. It can be applied to address multi-arm bandit problems and other forms of sequential decision-making challenges.
